**Hybrid Movie Recommendation System**
This project builds a Hybrid Movie Recommendation System that combines content-based filtering and collaborative filtering to provide personalized movie recommendations. It leverages user and movie data, such as genres, ratings, and relevance tags, to deliver tailored suggestions.

Project Overview
**The Hybrid Movie Recommendation System leverages two recommendation methods:**

Content-Based Filtering - Recommends movies with similar genres, tags, and metadata as those previously liked by the user.
Collaborative Filtering - Uses ratings from other users to suggest movies that similar users have enjoyed.
By combining both methods, this system aims to enhance recommendation accuracy and provide a more customized experience.

**Data Sources**
The project uses data from the MovieLens 20M dataset, which includes the following key files:

movies.csv: Contains movie information like movieId, title, and genres.
genome-scores.csv: Contains tags and relevance scores for each movie (movieId, tagId, relevance).
ratings.csv: User ratings for movies (userId, movieId, rating).
**Features and Objectives**
Personalized Recommendations: Suggest movies based on user preferences and movie metadata.
Data Processing: Preprocess data for memory efficiency and modeling.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Gain insights into user and movie patterns for model enhancement.
Hybrid Model: Use both collaborative and content-based techniques for improved recommendations.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
**The EDA step includes:**

Dataset Inspection: Checking for missing values, data types, and general structure.
Rating Distribution: Analyzing user rating tendencies using histograms and KDE plots.
Genre Popularity: Identifying popular genres to understand general movie preferences.
Tag Relevance: Examining the distribution of tag relevance scores to capture the semantic aspects of movies.
Modeling Approach
Data Preprocessing: Clean, merge, and reduce the memory usage of datasets.
Content-Based Filtering: Uses movie genres and tags to suggest similar movies based on content similarity.
Collaborative Filtering: Uses user ratings to find similar user preferences.
Hybrid Approach: Merges the outputs of content-based and collaborative filtering models to generate the final recommendations.

**Getting Started**
**Prerequisites**
Python 3.8 or higher
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-Learn
Seaborn
Matplotlib
Surprise (for collaborative filtering)




**Modeling:**

Content-Based Filtering: Run content_filtering.py to generate recommendations based on movie features.
Collaborative Filtering: Run collaborative_filtering.py to generate recommendations based on similar users.
Hybrid Model: Run hybrid_model.py to combine the two methods for final recommendations.
**Future Work**
Integrate a real-time user interface (e.g., using Streamlit) for interactive recommendations.
Experiment with more advanced collaborative filtering techniques like matrix factorization.
Explore fine-tuning the hybrid model with additional data, such as movie metadata and user demographics.
